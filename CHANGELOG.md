### 3.1.1

- No meaningful changes.

### 3.1.0

- `Dispatcher`: Methods `register` and `unregister` can once again be called in
  the middle of a dispatch.

### 3.0.0

- `FluxMapStore`: Removed. It added very little value over `FluxReduceStore`.
- `FluxContainer`: Subscriptions are setup in constructor rather than
  `componentDidMount`
- `FluxContainer`: Can create containers using stateless functional components
- `FluxContainer`: Uses functional version of `setState`
- `FluxMixin`: Subscriptions are setup in `componentWillMount` rather than
  `componentDidMount`
- `Dispatcher`: Methods `register` and `unregister` can not be called in the
  middle of a dispatch
- `React` added as peer dependency to `flux/utils`
- Package `dist/FluxUtils.js` alongside `dist/Flux.js`

_**Note**: This is marked as a breaking change due to the large number of small
changes in `FluxContainer`. Depending on how coupled code is to the timing of
`componentWillMount`, `componentDidMount`, or setting state synchronously it is
possible that there may be some breakages. Generally it should not be an issue._
