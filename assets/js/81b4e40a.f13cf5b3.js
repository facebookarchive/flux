For many years, web developers were taught that it was a good practice to write HTML, JavaScript and CSS separately. React does the exact opposite, and encourages that you write your HTML and ",(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://speakerdeck.com/vjeux/react-css-in-js"},"CSS in your JavaScript")," instead. This sounds like a crazy idea at first, but after trying it out, it actually isn't as weird as it sounds initially.

In the jQuery days, developers would have to come up with a series of steps to manipulate the DOM to get from one app state to the next. In React, you simply change the state within the component and the view will update itself according to the state. It is also easy to determine how the component will look like just by looking at the markup in the ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"render()")," method.")),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,o.kt)("p",{parentName:"li"},(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Functional")," - The view is a pure function of ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"props")," and ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"state"),". In most cases, a React component is defined by ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"props")," (external parameters) and ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"state")," (internal data). For the same ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"props")," and ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"state"),", the same view is produced. Pure functions are easy to test, and the same goes for functional components. Testing in React is made easy because a component's interfaces are well-defined and you can test the component by supplying different ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"props")," and ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"state")," to it and comparing the rendered output.")),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,o.kt)("p",{parentName:"li"},(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Maintainable")," - Writing your view in a component-based fashion encourages reusability. We find that defining a component's ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"propTypes")," make React code self-documenting as the reader can know clearly what is needed to use that component. Lastly, your view and logic is self-contained within the component, and should not be affected nor affect other components. That makes it easy to shift components around during large-scale refactoring, as long as the same ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"props")," are supplied to the component.")),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,o.kt)("p",{parentName:"li"},(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"High Performance")," - You might have heard that React uses a virtual DOM (not to be confused with ",(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Shadow_DOM"},"shadow DOM"),") and it re-renders everything when there is a change in state. Why is there a need for a virtual DOM? While modern JavaScript engines are fast, reading from and writing to the DOM is slow. React keeps a lightweight virtual representation of the DOM in memory. Re-rendering everything is a misleading term. In React it actually refers to re-rendering the in-memory representation of the DOM, not the actual DOM itself. When there's a change in the underlying data of the component, a new virtual representation is created, and compared against the previous representation. The difference (minimal set of changes required) is then patched to the real browser DOM.")),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,o.kt)("p",{parentName:"li"},(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Ease of Learning")," - Learning React is pretty simple.
